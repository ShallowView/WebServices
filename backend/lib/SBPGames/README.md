This repository contains the whole web system of SBP Games for our websites. You
will find there both our **own PHP framework**, following
[PSR](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/)s and a
[MVC pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller),
and every implementations needed to make working our websites, including the
**main one** and **thoses for each games**. It also keeps their designs and
their branding.

Moreover, we aren't using any dependencies manager or development tools except
thoses we make. They fit exacly conventions we follow and help us to keep a full
control over our development operations (project management). As every
developers of SBP Games use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and almost
the same extensions, we use and keep there its settings and configured tasks as
a development manager.
